# First Breakout
## Password Analyzer

Our very first lecture for the January 2019 cohort will be 
about creating a password analyzer. What is a password analyzer?
A program that receives one parameter and decides if that is a *good* password:

- Should include capital letters
- Should be really long...  13 characters
- should not have your name
- no dictionary words
- replace numbers for certain letters...   A -> 4   O -> 0
- should include some special characters...  !!!
